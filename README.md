### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm an all around data geek with a healthy appreciation for Data Visualization :bar_chart: and solving puzzles :female_detective:.

I'm also an aspiring Data Scientist: recently, I made the decision to leave my former position as a Data Product Manager to pursue an education in Data Science. I'm currently enrolled in a fulltime immersive program with General Assembly and loving it!

Most of my work is dedicaed to fun challenges like [#TidyTuesday](TidyTuesday) and [#30DayMapChallenge](30DayMapChallenge). I look forward to contributing more as I dig deeper into the exciting world of Data Science.
