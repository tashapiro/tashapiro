Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an all around data geek with a passion for Data Visualization :bar_chart: and solving puzzles :female_detective:.

I'm also an aspiring Data Scientist: recently, I made the decision to leave my former position as a Data Product Manager to pursue an education in Data Science. I'm currently enrolled in a fulltime immersive program with General Assembly and loving it!

Most of my work is dedicaed to fun challenges like [#TidyTuesday](TidyTuesday) and [#30DayMapChallenge](30DayMapChallenge). I look forward to contributing more as I dig deeper into the exciting world of Data Science.

- :earth_africa: **Fun** fact: I've lived in 4 different countries (US | CH | DE | SC)
- :biking_woman: **Hobbies**: Fitness & Guitar (I love my Peloton)


Some of my Data Science projects include:
- [Predicting Housing Prices](predicting-housing-prices)
- [Classifying Rotten Tomato Reviews (NLP)](nlp-rotten-tomatoes)
- [AskWomen vs. AskMen](subreddit-askwomen-askmen)
- [Music vs. Lyrics: Song Genre Classification](predicting-song-music-genre)

Let's Connect!
